## About This Project

TABI (Travel & Bahasa Indonesia) is an innovative application designed to bridge language gaps between international tourists and locals in Indonesia. It offers **real-time English-Indonesian translation**, along with curated insights into tourist destinations, local cuisines, and cultural etiquette. This app enhances the tourism experience and fosters cross-cultural understanding.

### Background
According to Indonesia's Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), approximately **8 million international tourists** visited Indonesia in 2023, a **96.9% increase** from the previous year. Despite this growth, **language barriers** continue to pose significant challenges, leading to miscommunication and limited engagement with local culture. TABI addresses these challenges by providing:
- **Seamless translation tools**
- **Cultural insights** for meaningful interactions
- **User-friendly design** to improve communication and promote cultural appreciation
